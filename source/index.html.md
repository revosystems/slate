# Introduction

Welcome to Revo API! You can use our API's to access [Xef](https://revo.works/en/products/revoxef), [Retail](https://revo.works/en/products/revoretail), [Flow](https://revo.works/en/products/revoflow) and [InTouch](https://revointouch.works) Endpoints.

You will be able to fetch records, update or fetch the catalog, create new orders and manage stock.
