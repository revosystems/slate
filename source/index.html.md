# Introduction

Welcome to Revo API! You can use our API's to access [Xef](https://revo.works/en/products/revoxef), [Retail](https://revo.works/en/products/revoretail), [Flow](https://revo.works/en/products/revoflow) and [InTouch](https://revointouch.works) Endpoints.

You will be able to fetch records, update or fetch the catalog, create new orders and manage stock.

Feel free to navigate through the docs and tell us if you feel that something can be improved.
